InsoScope provides a user-friendly interface to view, confirm, and inspect transactions on the Flatgas blockchain â€” a Layer 1 protocol built on predictability, fairness, and protocol-level fee stability.

It is a customized fork of [Blockscout](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout), adapted to reflect the design goals and branding of the Flatgas ecosystem and its native token, `inso`.

## About InsoScope

InsoScope allows users to search for transactions, view accounts and balances, verify smart contracts, and inspect the Flatgas chain transparently.

It builds on Blockscoutâ€™s open-source core, tailored to support the Flatgas chainâ€™s deterministic, non-bidding fee model.

## Getting Started

See the [project documentation](https://docs.blockscout.com/) for general instructions (valid for InsoScope too):

- [Manual deployment](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/deployment/manual-deployment-guide)
- [Docker-compose deployment](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/deployment/docker-compose-deployment)
- [ENV variables](https://docs.blockscout.com/setup/env-variables)
- [Configuration options](https://docs.blockscout.com/for-developers/configuration-options)

ðŸ§ª Development Environment (Planned Nix Support)

We plan to support Nix/NixOS-based development and deployment for InsoScope, to ensure reproducibility and environment consistency across contributors and nodes.

This is a work-in-progress as the team gradually integrates Nix support into our toolchain. Contributions welcome as we learn and build this support.


## Customization Highlights

- InsoScope branding (logo, name, color scheme)
- Flatgas chain configuration in progress
- Will evolve with native Flatgas protocol features
